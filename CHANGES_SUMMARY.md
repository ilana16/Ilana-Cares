# Resend Integration - Changes Summary

## Date
October 18, 2025

## Repository
https://github.com/ilana16/Ilana-Cares.git

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Resend Dependency

**File**: `package.json`

Added the Resend SDK to project dependencies:
```json
"resend": "^6.2.0"
```

Installed via: `pnpm add resend`

### 2. Rewrote Email Service

**File**: `server/email.ts`

**Before**: Used `nodemailer` with SMTP configuration for Gmail/Outlook
**After**: Uses Resend SDK with modern API-based email sending

**Key Changes**:
- Replaced `nodemailer.createTransport()` with `new Resend()`
- Simplified configuration (no SMTP host/port/TLS settings needed)
- Updated `sendBookingEmail()` function to use Resend API
- Updated `sendContactEmail()` function to use Resend API
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added null check for API key configuration

**Environment Variables Used**:
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Required, Resend API key
- `EMAIL_FROM` - Optional, defaults to `"Ilana Cares <onboarding@resend.dev>"`
- `EMAIL_TO` - Optional, defaults to `"ilana.cunningham16@gmail.com"`

### 3. Updated Routers to Use Email Notifications

**File**: `server/routers.ts`

**Changes**:
- Added import: `import { sendBookingEmail, sendContactEmail } from "./email";`
- Added email notification call in booking submission handler (line ~91-101)
- Added email notification call in contact form submission handler (line ~160-166)
- Both email calls are non-blocking (use `.catch()` to handle errors gracefully)

**Behavior**:
- Booking submissions now trigger BOTH Manus notification AND email notification
- Contact form submissions now trigger BOTH Manus notification AND email notification
- If email sending fails, it logs an error but doesn't affect the user experience

### 4. Updated Environment Variables Template

**File**: `.env.example`

**Added**:
```bash
# Email Configuration (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_resend_api_key_here
EMAIL_FROM=Ilana Cares <noreply@yourdomain.com>
EMAIL_TO=ilana.cunningham16@gmail.com
```

### 5. Created Documentation

**New Files**:
- `RESEND_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive setup instructions for Resend integration
- `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - This file, documenting all changes made

## Migration Notes

### Removed Dependencies
None - `nodemailer` is still in `package.json` but is no longer used. You can optionally remove it:
```bash
pnpm remove nodemailer @types/nodemailer
```

### Backward Compatibility
The changes are fully backward compatible:
- If `RESEND_API_KEY` is not set, email sending will fail gracefully with a logged error
- The Manus notification system continues to work as before
- No breaking changes to the API or user-facing functionality

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Set `RESEND_API_KEY` in environment variables
- [ ] Submit a test booking and verify email is received
- [ ] Submit a test contact form and verify email is received
- [ ] Check application logs for any errors
- [ ] Verify emails are not going to spam folder

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Integrate Resend for email notifications"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Set environment variables in Railway**:
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` (required)
   - `EMAIL_FROM` (optional)
   - `EMAIL_TO` (optional)

3. **Deploy** (automatic on Railway after push)

4. **Test** the integration with real submissions

## Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback:

1. Revert the commit:
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Or manually:
   - Remove the email function calls from `server/routers.ts`
   - The Manus notification system will continue to work

## Benefits of This Integration

1. **Better Deliverability**: Resend has better email deliverability than SMTP
2. **Easier Configuration**: No need to manage SMTP credentials or app passwords
3. **Modern API**: RESTful API with better error handling
4. **Analytics**: Track email opens, clicks, and delivery status in Resend dashboard
5. **Scalability**: Easy to scale from free tier to paid plans as business grows
6. **Dual Notifications**: Redundancy with both Manus and email notifications
