# Railway.app Deployment Guide for Ilana Cares

This guide will walk you through deploying the Ilana Cares website to Railway.app.

## Prerequisites

- Railway.app account (sign up at https://railway.app)
- GitHub account (your code is already pushed to https://github.com/ilana16/Ilana-Cares)
- MySQL database (Railway provides this)

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Create Railway Account

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click "Login" and sign in with your GitHub account
3. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub repositories

### 2. Create New Project

1. Click "New Project" on the Railway dashboard
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Choose your repository: `ilana16/Ilana-Cares`
4. Railway will automatically detect it's a Node.js project

### 3. Add MySQL Database

1. In your Railway project, click "+ New"
2. Select "Database" â†’ "Add MySQL"
3. Railway will provision a MySQL database and automatically set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Click on your service â†’ "Variables" tab and add these environment variables:

**Required Variables (Already Auto-Injected by Manus Platform):**
- `DATABASE_URL` - (Automatically set by Railway MySQL)
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to `production`
- `PORT` - Set to `3000` (or leave empty, Railway auto-assigns)

**Platform Variables (Copy from Manus):**
These are already configured in your Manus project but need to be added to Railway:

```
JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
OAUTH_SERVER_URL=https://api.manus.im
VITE_APP_ID=<your-app-id>
VITE_OAUTH_PORTAL_URL=https://portal.manus.im
OWNER_OPEN_ID=<your-owner-id>
OWNER_NAME=<your-name>
VITE_APP_TITLE=Ilana Cares
VITE_APP_LOGO=https://your-logo-url.com/logo.png
BUILT_IN_FORGE_API_URL=<your-forge-api-url>
BUILT_IN_FORGE_API_KEY=<your-forge-api-key>
VITE_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT=<your-analytics-endpoint>
VITE_ANALYTICS_WEBSITE_ID=<your-analytics-id>
```

**Note:** The Gmail password and Firebase API key are currently hardcoded in the source files. For production, you should move these to environment variables.

### 5. Deploy

1. Railway will automatically start building and deploying
2. Wait for the build to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)
3. Once deployed, Railway will provide a public URL (e.g., `https://ilana-cares-production.up.railway.app`)

### 6. Run Database Migrations

After the first deployment:

1. Go to your service in Railway
2. Click on the "..." menu â†’ "View Logs"
3. The database tables should be automatically created on first run
4. If not, you may need to run: `pnpm db:push` (Railway provides a way to run commands)

### 7. Test Your Deployment

1. Visit your Railway URL
2. Test all pages:
   - Home page
   - About Ilana
   - Rates
   - Booking (check calendar integration)
   - Payment Options
   - Contact form

### 8. Custom Domain (Optional)

To use your own domain:

1. In Railway, go to your service â†’ "Settings"
2. Scroll to "Domains"
3. Click "Custom Domain"
4. Follow the instructions to add your domain
5. Update your DNS records as instructed

## Important Notes

### Email Configuration

The Gmail SMTP credentials are currently hardcoded in `server/email.ts`:
- Email: `ilana.cunningham16@gmail.com`
- App Password: `zipe yywl pfwh acbw` (remove spaces)

**Security Recommendation:** Move these to environment variables:
1. Add `GMAIL_USER` and `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` to Railway environment variables
2. Update `server/email.ts` to use `process.env.GMAIL_USER` and `process.env.GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`

### Firebase Configuration

Firebase credentials are in `client/src/lib/firebase.ts`. These are safe to keep in the code as they're meant to be public (with proper Firebase security rules).

### Calendar Integration

The Google Calendar .ics URL is in `server/calendar.ts`. This is a private calendar URL, so keep it secure.

### Database Backups

Railway provides automatic backups for paid plans. For the free tier:
1. Regularly export your database
2. Consider upgrading to a paid plan for production use

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

- Check the build logs in Railway
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify Node.js version compatibility

### Database Connection Issues

- Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly
- Check database logs in Railway
- Ensure database is running

### Application Crashes

- Check application logs in Railway
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Check for missing dependencies

### Email Not Sending

- Verify Gmail App Password is correct (no spaces)
- Check if Gmail account has "Less secure app access" enabled (or use App Password)
- Check application logs for SMTP errors

## Cost Estimate

**Railway Pricing:**
- **Hobby Plan (Free)**: $5 credit/month, good for testing
- **Developer Plan**: $5/month + usage (~$10-20/month total for this app)
- **Team Plan**: $20/month + usage

For a production babysitting website with moderate traffic, expect around $10-15/month.

## Support

- Railway Documentation: https://docs.railway.app
- Railway Discord: https://discord.gg/railway
- GitHub Issues: https://github.com/ilana16/Ilana-Cares/issues

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Test thoroughly** - Try booking, contact forms, etc.
2. **Set up monitoring** - Use Railway's built-in metrics
3. **Configure backups** - Export database regularly
4. **Add custom domain** - Use your own domain name
5. **Update OAuth redirect URLs** - If using Manus OAuth, update allowed callback URLs
6. **Monitor costs** - Keep an eye on Railway usage
